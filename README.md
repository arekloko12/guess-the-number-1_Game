# My #1 game in python

```Powershell
print("Hello everyone")
```

### <strong>"Guess the number"</strong> is my first of the larger projects done using the Python programming language, but not only. This is generally my first such big project and I hope that the next ones will be even bigger, better, more advanced. In the future, my plan is to make the same game using only the graphical interface.  I'm not a very experienced programmer yet, I'm learning all the time, so some people may notice small or big bugs in the project that I don't know about yet.
